# Machine-Learning-projects
In this repository there are some machine learning projects. This is the result of the specialization course of courser about machine learning. The datasets are provided by kaggle. 

## MERCEDES BENZ PROJECT
-In this project we have studied the dataset about the price of some mercedes'model related with other features(model, review count, number of doors, etc..). The main goal is create a regression model to predict the price of a particular model of the car. We have followed the data science work flow:
    - Domain understanding
    - Loading and reading the Dataset
    - Exploration analysis 
    - Preprocessing Data
    - Building model
    - Evaluation model
