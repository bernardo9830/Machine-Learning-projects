# Machine-Learning-projects
In this repository there are some machine learning projects. This is the result of the specialization course of courser about machine learning. The datasets are provided by kaggle. 

## MERCEDES BENZ PROJECT
-In this project we have studied the dataset about the price of some mercedes'model related with other features(model, review count, number of doors, etc..). The main goal is create a regression model to predict the price of a particular model of the car. We have followed the data science work flow:
    - Domain understanding
    - Loading and reading the Dataset
    - Exploration analysis 
    - Preprocessing Data
    - Building model
    - Evaluation model

## HEART DISAES PROJECT

The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information.
